## Usage
The `forge-visionferret-h8.sh` build script serves as the single entrypoint for provisioning nodes. Run the script as your standard user, as it internally escalates to `sudo` when necessary.

**Standard Provisioning**
To run the generic core setup:
```bash
./forge-visionferret-h8.sh --all
```

**Headless Tailscale Mesh**
To run the core setup and install Tailscale:
```bash
./forge-visionferret-h8.sh --all --tailscale
```

**Granular Stage Execution**
You can execute individual phases manually if a kernel update forces a reboot mid-process:
*   `--core`: Executes `run_core()` for system locales, APT sources, and OS de-bloating.
*   `--driver`: Executes `run_driver()` to compile and install the PCIe driver and firmware.
*   `--api`: Executes `run_api()` to compile the HailoRT C++ API and `pyhailort` wheel.
*   `--uv`: Executes `run_uv()` to install the Astral `uv` tool.
*   `--tailscale`: Executes `run_tailscale()` to install Tailscale and enable zero-trust SSH.

```python
# Example of using the Hailo-8(L) Edge AI NPU Inference Engine for image recognition

class Hailo8LInferenceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.npu = "Hailo-8(L)"
        self.top_performance = 26  # TOPS
        self.low_power_consumption = True

    def run_inference(self, image):
        # Simulate running inference on an image
        print(f"Running inference on image using {self.npu} NPU.")
        # Simulate processing time
        import time
        time.sleep(0.1)
        return "Object detected: Cat"

# Create an instance of the inference engine
engine = Hailo8LInferenceEngine()

# Simulate running inference on an image
result = engine.run_inference("path_to_image.jpg")
print(result)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the RISC-V Hailo-8(L) Edge AI NPU Inference Engine for image recognition. The `Hailo8LInferenceEngine` class simulates the engine's capabilities, including running inference on an image and simulating the processing time. The example shows how to create an instance of the engine and run inference on an image, simulating the detection of an object.
